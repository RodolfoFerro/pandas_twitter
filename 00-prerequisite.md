# 0. Prerequisite: What will we need?

First of all, we need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
I'm almost sure that all the code will run in Python 2.7, but I'll use Python 3.6. I highly recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which is a very useful Python distribution to manage packages that includes a lot of useful tools, such as [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). I'll explain the code supposing that we will be using a Jupyter Notebook, but the code will run if you are programming a simple script from your text editor. You'll just need to adapt it (it's not hard).

The requirements that we'll need to install are:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): This is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/): This is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
* [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/): This is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/): This is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): This is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
* [Textblob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/): This is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

All of them are "*pip installable*". At the end of this article you'll be able to find more references about this Python libraries.

**Now that we have all the requirements, let's get started!**
