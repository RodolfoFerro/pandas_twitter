> #### DESCRIPTION:
>In this workshop we will:

>2. Do some basic statistics and visualizations with numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
>3. Do sentiment analysis of extracted (Trump's) tweets using textblob.

You'll find this workshop quite interesting. It was originally delivered in *Mexico City* for an awesome group of students at [Laboratoria](http://laboratoria.la/en). All workshop instructions assume minimal prior experience with the Twitter API, statistics, and data visualization. All code can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pandas_twitter/blob/master/Minado%20de%20datos%20en%20Twitter.ipynb).

For this workshop I'll be using the [4.3.0](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/4.3.0) of the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) (check their [LICENSE](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/COPYING.md)), but any greater release until the current one ([5.1.0](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/releases/tag/5.1.0)) will work fine.


## Contents

You will find a well structured markdown file containing the contents for each section, you can directly begin on the [prerequisite](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pandas_twitter/blob/master/00-prerequisite.md) section. At the end of each file you'll find the direct link to the next/previous section, so you do not need to keep going back to this README in order to got to the desired section.
